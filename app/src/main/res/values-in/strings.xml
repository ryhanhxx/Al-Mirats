    <string name="title_materi_1">What is Inheritance</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_1">Definition Inheritance</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_1">What is meant by "inheritance" is property or money left behind by the person who died. Inheritance can consist of many types of assets, including money, investments, and other items of value. The following differences are between the phrases “inheritance” and “will”.
        \n\nInheritance is property that is distributed based on legal provisions, be it Islamic law or state law. A will, on the other hand, is a document that contains the personal wishes of the owner of the property, and needs to be executed in accordance with applicable law.</string>
    <string name="subheading_materi_1">Inheritance According to Islamic Law</string>
    <string name="subdesc_materi_1">In Islamic law, the Qur\'an has special guidelines regarding inheritance. These rules will determine how the assets left behind will be divided among successors, and the Islamic inheritance system is based on the idea of justice. Heirs in Islamic law include husband, wife, children, parents, and siblings. Ensuring that inheritance assets are allocated fairly based on family relationships and degree of dependency is a key objective of the Islamic inheritance system.</string>

    <string name="title_materi_2">Verses Explaining About Inheritance</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_2">Verses from the Qur-an about Inheritance</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_2">There are several verses in the Qur-an that explain the distribution of inheritance. Among them is the word of Allah\n
         \nلِلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالْأَقْرَبُون َ وَلِلنِّسَاءِ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا تَرَكَ الْوَالِدَانِ وَالْأَقْروبَُُ \n
         \nFor men there is the right to share in the assets inherited from their parents and relatives, and for women there is the right to share (also) in the assets inherited from their parents and relatives, whether a little or a lot according to the portion that has been determined. (QS. An Nisaa : 7)</string>
    <string name="subheading_materi_2">Reference</string>
    <string name="subdesc_materi_2">In the past, during the period of ignorance, the Arabs, due to their arbitrariness and harsh nature, did not give inheritance to weak people such as women and children, they only gave it to strong men. This is because, in their opinion, men are the ones who take part in war, and they are also the ones who have the right to receive the spoils of war. So Rabb, the Most Merciful, the Most Wise, wanted to establish a Shari ah that equalizes (the right to receive inheritance) between men and women, strong people and weak people. (Taisir Al-Karim Ar-Rahman fi Tafsir Kalam Al-Mannan, Page 201)</string>

    <string name="title_materi_3">Which Parties Have the Right to Receive Inheritance</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_3">the party entitled to receive it</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_3">The recipients of the inheritance are called heirs, and Islamic inheritance law has determined the order and portion of each heir. Heirs can consist of the nuclear family such as children, husband or wife, as well as wider family such as parents, siblings and even distant relatives.</string>

    <string name="title_materi_4">What is the Structure of the Main Inheritance Division</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_4">Section for primary heirs</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_4">A. Husband: The husband has the right to receive an inheritance share from the deceased wifes assets, if the wife does not have children or other descendants. The husbands share is one-fourth of the wifes assets if the wife has no children, and one-eighth if the wife has children.\n
         \nB. Wife: The wife has the right to receive an inheritance share from the deceased husbands assets, if the husband has no children. The wifes share is one-fourth of the husbands property if the husband has no children, and one-eighth if the husband has children.\n
         \nC. Children: Children have great inheritance rights in Islam. Boys get twice as much as girls. The share of children depends on the number of children who died, the number of sons and daughters who are still alive.\n
         \nD. Parents: Parents also have an inheritance share in the assets of their deceased children. The parents share depends on whether the deceased child had children or not.\n
         \nE. Siblings: Siblings, both male and female, also have an inheritance share in the property left by their sibling.</string>

    <string name="title_materi_5">Whose Parties are Blocked by the Main Heirs</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_5">Whose Party is Obstructed</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_5">In Islamic inheritance law, there are parties who are prevented from receiving the main inheritance. These obstructed parties are called "mahrum." They have no inheritance rights if there are other living heirs. The following are some examples of obstructed parties:\n
         \nA. Heirs who are not Muslim: Parties who do not convert to Islam usually do not have inheritance rights to the assets of Muslim heirs. This includes non-Muslims such as parents, siblings, or children who do not follow Islam.\n
         \nB. Murderer: A person who kills another heir intentionally will not have the right to inherit the property of the murder victim. This is called the rule of "murder through inheritance rights."\n
         \nC. Guardian in a Will: A person appointed as a guardian in a will, usually to manage inherited assets, has no inheritance rights to the assets.</string>

    <string name="title_materi_6">Understanding Aul and Radd in Waris</string>
    <string name="heading_materi_6">What is meant by Aul</string>
    <string name="desc_materi_6">Aul is a recalculation carried out to ensure that all heirs receive their fair share in accordance with Islamic law.
        \n\nAul\'s example is:
        \nThe share of a husband who should get half ½ can change to one third ⅓ in certain circumstances, such as if the subject matter is increased from the original six 6 to nine 9. So in this case a husband who should get 3/ 6 half only gets 3/9 one third.</string>
    <string name="subheading_materi_6">What is meant by Radd</string>
    <string name="subdesc_materi_6">Radd, on the other hand, is the return of all or part of the inherited assets received by unrightful heirs.
        \n\nFor example, in a situation (in the distribution of inheritance rights) the heirs have received their respective rights, but it turns out that the inheritance still remains while there is no other relative as ashabah, then the remaining inheritance is given or returned again. to the ashhabul furudh according to their respective parts.</string>

    <!--    TODO: FATWA-->
    <string name="title_fatwa_1">Haven\'t paid the fasting debt and then dies, will the heirs make up for it or what?</string>
    <string name="title_fatwa_2">Can male and female inheritance be equal?</string>
    <string name="title_fatwa_3">What if the inheritance is greater for those who have contributed more to the deceased?</string>
    <string name="title_fatwa_4">Is there a verse in the Koran that requires us to divide inheritance according to Sharia?</string>
    <string name="title_fatwa_5">What is the Law on Distributing Inheritance Not According to Allah SWT\'s Law?</string>
    <string name="title_fatwa_6">Wills for Heirs, Are They Required to Be Executed</string>

    <string name="desc_fatwa_1">Regarding fasting debts that have not been paid before a person dies, the opinion of the majority of scholars is that the Heirs are not obliged to make up for (replace) fasts that have not been fulfilled by the deceased. This is because the obligation to fast is personal and cannot be replaced by another person after a persons death.</string>
    <string name="desc_fatwa_2">In Islam, the share of inheritance between men and women is not equal. Men\'s share of inheritance is greater than women\'s in some situations. In inheritance, a daughter gets half the inheritance of a son.</string>
    <string name="desc_fatwa_3">In Islam, the basic principle of dividing inheritance is fair and in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Koran. Even though someone has contributed more to the deceased, the distribution of inheritance still follows the established provisions of Islamic inheritance law. It is not permitted to give a larger portion to one heir based solely on certain services.</string>
    <string name="desc_fatwa_4">In the Al-Qur\'an there are verses that regulate the distribution of inheritance according to sharia. One verse that explains this is in Surah An-Nisa (4:11-12):
         "11. Allah conveys His command to you regarding (distribution of inheritance) to your children: the share of one son is equal to the share of two daughters, and if there are more than two daughters, then they get two-thirds of the property who is left behind; and if she is only a daughter, then she will share half. And to the parents (heirs) of each of them one-sixth of the property he left behind, if he has children; and if he has no children and his parents inherit the property then his mother gets one-third. And if the one who leaves him has brothers or sisters, then each of them gets one-sixth. And if the person who leaves him has many brothers and sisters, then his sister gets one-sixth ; and to each of his brothers a portion. (That is) Allah's decree which He has given you; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."</string>
    <string name="desc_fatwa_5">Distributing inheritance not in accordance with Allah SWT\'s law (syar\'i) is considered a serious violation in Islam. Canceling or changing the inheritance provisions that have been determined by Islamic law can be considered an illegal action and can lead to sin. In Islam, observance of Allah\'s inheritance laws is an obligation, and violation of them can result in legal and moral consequences.</string>
    <string name="desc_fatwa_6">Wills in Islam are permitted, but there are certain limitations and conditions that must be followed. A will can only cover one third of the inheritance and must not harm the heirs determined by Islamic inheritance law. In this case, the will is not required to be fully implemented, but must comply with these provisions.</string>
